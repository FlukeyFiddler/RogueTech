Adds several new weapons and actuators based on industrial machinery, as might be found mounted on an agricultureal, mining or construction mech.

Includes six new support weapons, which have a maximum range of 1 hex:
Cultivator and Chainsaw deal physical damage, can be bought on Agricultural worlds.
Jackhammer and Mining Drill deal physical and stability damage, can be bought on Mining worlds.
Arc Welder and Plasma Torch deal physical and heat damage, can be bought on Manufacturing worlds.

Also includes two new hand actuators:
Cargo Grip grants bonus stability damage in melee
Excavator Claw grants bonus physical damage in melee.

All of the above have a small penalty to hit to reflect the fact they're tools rather than weapons.


This mod requires BattleTech Mod Loader (BTML) and ModTek to function. Which can be found here:
https://github.com/Mpstark/ModTek


To Install:
1) install BTML and ModTek if you have not already done so.
2) unzip and place the folder "Handy Industrial Weapons" into your "BATTLETECH/Mods" directory.


To Uninstall:
1) *Delete any campaign savegames made while using this mod.
2) *Delete any skirmish mech loadouts using items from this mod.
3) Delete the folder "Handy Industrial Weapons" from your "BATTLETECH/Mods" directory.

*Steps 1 and 2 are IMPORTANT. If you skip these then you'll end up with an infinite loading screen when you try to load the save or open the skirmish mechlab, while the game looks for files that no longer exist. To fix: re-install this mod, delete those loadouts/savegames, then delete the mod again.
